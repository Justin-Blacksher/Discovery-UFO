# Discovery-UFO
Python prototype to build a UFO tracking application. 

This python prototype will be used to make the final project. 

The database will be hosted online VIA Amazon AWS or Azure. 

Users will then be able to register their 'team' or 'solitary' account and manage their team
via a client program. 

Each team will be opt to be assigned areas or pick areas. 

This app will track.
- UFO sightings
- Abductions (reported)
- Times/Dates/Pictures
- Auto-Generated interview forms

Users will be able to:
- Look at recent sightings
- compare their reportings to others in the same area
- collaborate with other teams.
- talk about equiptment
- future (possibly a store link with gear)
